CRITICAL: Follow Karpathy's teaching philosophy:

1. EVERY concept must be built from scratch first
2. Start with 10-line toy implementations
3. No concept without code
4. Overfit on one example before generalizing
5. Include "instrument this" exercises (add prints/plots)
6. Add "break this" exercises (introduce bugs to fix)
7. Each module produces a runnable .py file
8. Debugging challenges are part of curriculum
9. Prefer "make X fail, then fix it" over "implement X correctly"
10. End each module with "simplify this" refactoring

Structure modules as:
- Tiny baseline (20 lines max)
- Instrument it (add logging)
- Break it (introduce bug)
- Fix it (debug)
- Scale it (add complexity)
- Simplify it (refactor)
- Ship it (runnable artifact)
